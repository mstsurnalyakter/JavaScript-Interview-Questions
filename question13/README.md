#  Write about the errors shown in JavaScript?

`Load-time errors`: The errors shown at the time of the page loading are counted under Load-time errors. The use of improper syntax encounters these errors and is thus detected while the page is getting loaded.

`Runtime errors`: This is the error that comes up while the program is running. For example, illegal operations cause the division of a number by zero or access a non-existent area of the memory.

`Logic errors`: It is caused by syntactically correct code, which does not fulfill the required taskâ€”for example, an infinite loop.
