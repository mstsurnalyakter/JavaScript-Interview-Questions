# What is `===` operator?

To submit a form using JavaScript use

````js
document.form[0].submit();
document.form[0].submit();
````


# Difference between `“==”` and `“===”`?

`“==”` checks only for equality in value, whereas `“===”` is a stricter equality test and returns false if either the value or the type of the two variables are different.
